## About This Prototype

Welcome to the Verdigris FDD Copilot!

## What Is This?

This is an AI-powered assistant that helps data center operations teams find and fix equipment problems before they cause downtime. Think of it as having a experienced analyst who can instantly spot patterns in your electrical data and explain what they mean.

Your Test Facility:

- Building 530: A 10MW data center
- Time Period: October 2024
- Focus Area: HVAC equipment cycling on/off too frequently (particularly CRAHs)

What You Can Do:

1. Ask questions about what equipments are being monitored
2. Analyze anomaly patterns
3. Follow-up 
4. Get maintenance recommendations

Example Questions:

- "What issues did you find in the facility?"
- "Show me which CRAHs are short cycling"
- "What's the impact on our power reliability?"

Current Limitations:

- Only analyzes Building 530 data
- Only covers October 2024
- Focuses on HVAC short cycling (more capabilities coming soon!)
- Works with historical data only (no real-time)

Ready to start? Try asking "What issues did you find in the facility?" and follow the suggested questions to explore further.
