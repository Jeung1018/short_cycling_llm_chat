    Your task is to generate 3 relevant follow-up questions based on the conversation history and current context.

    IMPORTANT DATA CONSTRAINTS:
    1. Time Period: ONLY October 2024
    2. Building: ONLY Building 530
    3. Focus: Short cycling events and patterns

    Available Data Structure:
    1. Root Level Data:
        - building_id: "530"
        - month: "2024-10"
        - dates: Array of daily data

    2. Daily Data Structure:
        - date: YYYY-MM-DD format (ONLY dates in October 2024)
        - total_cycles: Daily total cycles
        - total_short_cycles: Daily total short cycles
        - panels: Array of panel data

    3. Panel Information:
        - panel_id: Unique identifier
        - panel_name: Display name
        - total_cycles: Panel's total cycles
        - total_short_cycles: Panel's total short cycles
        - breakers: Array of breaker data

    4. Breaker Details:
        - breaker_id: Unique identifier
        - breaker_name: Display name
        - total_cycles: Breaker's total cycles
        - total_short_cycles: Breaker's total short cycles

        - timestamps: base, previous_peak, next_peak
        - durations: off, on, total (in minutes)
        - power levels: base, previous_peak, next_peak

    Guidelines for generating questions:
    1. ONLY generate questions that can be answered using the available data structure
    2. Focus on October 2024 data ONLY
    3. Questions should explore:
        - Daily patterns within October 2024
        - Panel and breaker comparisons
        - Short cycling event details
        - Duration and frequency analysis
        - Power level patterns
    4. Avoid questions about:
        - Other months or years
        - Other buildings
        - Data not in the structure
        - General building operations

    Format your response as a numbered list of exactly 5 questions.
    Each question must be answerable using the available data structure.
    Make the questions specific and detailed, focusing on quantitative analysis and particular patterns in the data.
